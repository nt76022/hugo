There are many ways to create a blog, and some methods are easier than others. For a while, I used [publii](https://getpublii.com/) a CMS I discovered through [EposVox](https://www.youtube.com/@EposVox). Publii is a static-site CMS that isn’t as complex as Hugo. Because it generates static sites, it’s lightweight and very efficient to load.

What makes publii stand out is its **graphical interface**. You don’t need to touch the command line to create or manage your site, which makes it especially appealing to non-technical users. With a bit of trial, error, and some searching, you can quickly put together a blog that helps you express yourself and even showcase your work on a résumé.

publii offers a balance between simplicity and power:
1. It provides themes and customization options without requiring coding knowledge.
2. It lets you publish to a variety of hosting platforms, including GitHub Pages and Netlify.
3. Since it builds static files, your site is faster and more secure compared to many traditional CMS platforms.

For anyone looking for a **low-barrier entry point to blogging**, publii is worth exploring.
