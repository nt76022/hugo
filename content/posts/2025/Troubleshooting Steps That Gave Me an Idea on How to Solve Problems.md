While studying for the **Linux+ certification**, I came across the standard troubleshooting process used in IT. At first, I thought it was just another framework to memorize, but then I realized: these steps can apply to *many* areas of life beyond technology.  

Here are the seven troubleshooting steps:

1. **Identify the problem**  
2. **Come up with a theory**  
3. **Test the theory**  
4. **Come up with a plan**  
5. **Implement the plan**  
6. **Test for functionality**  
7. **Document the process**  

Depending on the problem, these steps don’t always happen in strict order — sometimes they overlap, or you combine them together. But the structure is powerful.

## Applying Troubleshooting Outside of IT

To show how flexible this process is, let me walk through an example: **learning how to draw**.

1. **Identify the problem**  
   → *“I can’t draw well.”*  
2. **Come up with a theory**  
   → *“Maybe I don’t actually know the fundamentals of drawing.”*  
3. **Test the theory**  
   → Try doodling something simple. (This could also be part of step 5.)  
4. **Come up with a plan**  
   → *“I’ll practice drawing for 1 hour a day for 30 days while using art books or online tutorials.”*  
5. **Implement the plan**  
   → Begin the 30-day drawing challenge.  
6. **Test for functionality**  
   → Compare your first doodle to your 30th-day drawing. Look for improvement.  
7. **Document the process**  
   → Save your drawings and write down how you felt, what you learned, and where you still want to grow.  

By documenting, you keep your ideas and progress in a “second brain.” You can look back at them for encouragement and even use the same process to tackle other challenges.

## Beyond IT and Art
This troubleshooting mindset can apply to:  
- Relationships  
- Car maintenance  
- Workplace challenges  
- Management decisions  
- Even government or large-scale problems  

It’s not just for fixing servers or Linux systems — it’s a universal way of approaching challenges.

## Final Thoughts
Coming across this framework was an eye-opener for me. I haven’t implemented it fully outside of IT yet, but I see its potential everywhere.  

The next time you hit a roadblock — whether in technology, life, or creativity — try applying the troubleshooting steps. You might be surprised how effective they are.
