why are we buying tv for every room. i see them in every room in a modern houce one in the kitchen oh lets put them in to the bedroom and lets put them out side so will we are swimming we can watch the TV. so we will buy cheap tv that can be briked over the internet because we didn't not give them anothe money. oh on top of that we spend all the money on many TV then one good tv in a sentimental location. with nice speackers that make the athure half of the imertions experience. 

for the money you spend on TV and sound bars that we put up. we can spenf the muney on a big tv and a 5.1 to 7.1.4 sround sound system. and you can go on ebay or cyrigslisjh for the speaskers. so it is not as much money than you think of if you go secont hand.  you can buy 3 cheap TV that are 45inch for a the same price as a 55 inch oled tv pluse not includoing all the cable and cabinets that you will need to get.OPP
