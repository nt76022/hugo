If you’re in high school or college, you need to know how to study. Studying effectively helps you learn faster and more efficiently. As a neurodivergent person, you may find traditional study methods challenging, but there are strategies that can make learning easier.  

This is not a one-size-fits-all guide. Instead, these are suggestions you can try, because everyone learns differently.

## Flashcards  
For tests, you often need to memorize information by heart. Flashcards are one of the best tools for this.  

- **Spaced Repetition:** Flashcards can be used with systems like Anki or Quizlet, which show you the cards you don’t know more often and the ones you do know less frequently. This way, you spend time where it matters most.  
- **Efficiency:** Instead of trying to memorize a whole book, you break it into small, testable chunks.  
- **Visuals:** Adding images to your flashcards can make the information easier to remember.

## Note-Taking  
Taking notes is essential, but how you take them matters.  

- **Handwrite First:** Studies show handwriting notes can increase retention by about 25% compared to typing. When you write, you process the information more deeply.  
- **Type Later:** After class, type your notes into a digital system. This second pass through the material reinforces it in your memory.  
- **Second Brain:** Store your notes in a system (like Obsidian, Notion, or OneNote) so you can organize and reference them later for school, work, or personal life.  

### Different Note-Taking Methods  
- **Mind Maps:** Useful for visualizing concepts, brainstorming essays, or connecting story ideas.  
- **Cornell Method:** Structured notes divided into cues, notes, and summaries.  
- **Outline Method:** Organized hierarchically with bullet points.  
- **Learning Cards:** Questions and answers written like mini flashcards based on lectures.  

Experiment to see what works best for you. For example, mind maps might help in English or history, while outlines could be better for math or science.

## Using AI (Carefully)  
AI can be helpful, but don’t rely on it to do your work.  

- **What Not to Do:** Copying full assignments from AI. You won’t learn anything and it can get you in trouble.  
- **What to Try:** Have AI reword difficult concepts, explain ideas in simpler language, or make connections you didn’t think of yourself.  

AI should be a tool to *support* your learning, not replace it.

## Staying on Task  
- **Make a Schedule:** Use time-blocking or the Pomodoro method (25 minutes of study, 5 minutes break).  
- **Set Goals:** Be specific—say “learn 10 flashcards on World War II causes” instead of just “study history.”  
- **Be Flexible:** If a method isn’t working, switch it up. Everyone’s brain works differently.

✅ **Key Point:** There’s no single “right” way to study. The best method is the one that keeps you engaged, helps you remember, and works with how *your* brain learns.
