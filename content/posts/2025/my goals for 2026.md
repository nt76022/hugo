## Setting My 2026 Goals

I want to set ambitious but achievable goals for myself for the upcoming year. I’ll break these down by quarter to match my academic (college semester) calendar, making them more actionable and trackable. Each quarter will focus on milestones that build toward my annual objectives.

---

## Yearly Theme & Objectives

These are my main goals for 2026. Each quarterly goal will help move me toward these bigger achievements:

- **Achieve C1 (or at least B2) German language proficiency** by the end of the year.
- **Earn multiple IT certifications** (LPIC-1, RHCSA/RHEL, and others).
- **Grow my YouTube channels**, increasing subscribers and consistency.
- **Save $X in my bank account** (target to be determined).
- **Improve my drawing/art skills** through regular practice and courses.
