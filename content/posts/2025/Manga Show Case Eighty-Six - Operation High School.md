## 🧭 Story & Pacing
This is a fun alternate take on the *86* characters, placing them in a typical Japanese high school setting. It doesn’t connect to the main series canon, but all the character quirks and charm are still present. It's a standalone volume, self-contained with 16 chapters and a character list at the end. The pace is light and easy, with a comfortable slice-of-life flow.

---

## 👥 Characters
The main focus is on:
- **Lena** – Student Council President  
- **Shin** – Quiet but reliable  

The story builds on the developing bond between Lena and Shin, leaning into sweet and subtle romantic moments. Other familiar characters make appearances too.

## 🎨 Art & Paneling
The art follows a clean, standard manga style. It’s easy to follow with good panel flow and expressive characters, sticking to classic shoujo/slice-of-life visuals.

---

## 🎭 Themes & Tone
The manga reimagines the core *86* cast in a lighthearted school setting. The tone is playful and romantic, with no war or politics—just uniforms, student council meetings, and teenage awkwardness.

---

## 💭 Personal Thoughts
It’s an easy, enjoyable read with no complex plotlines. I’d love to see more volumes like this in the future—it’s a great "what if" side story.
