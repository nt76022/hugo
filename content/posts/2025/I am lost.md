# From My Ideals Journal to Productivity Reset  

Since 5th grade, I’ve carried a notebook I called my *Ideals Journal*. It was my personal place to write down ideas, thoughts, and sparks of inspiration. Over the years, I filled four of these notebooks. But the last one is barely touched.  

Why? Because I’ve had fewer raw “big ideas” recently, and because I’ve been trying to go digital. The problem is, I haven’t figured out a smooth way to bring my drawings and handwritten notes into a digital note-taking app. I’ve tried in the past, but I never knew what I was doing, and I gave up.  

That’s not even the real reason I feel lost. The bigger problem is that I’m caught between *three different physical notebooks* and a *digital system*. I don’t know where to put my information anymore.  

Some things, like my diary, are probably best left in a physical notebook. The ritual and privacy of handwriting fit better there. But my ideas and book notes would definitely benefit from being digital. Digital notes are searchable, easier to organize, and more useful in the long run.  

I also carry a traveler-sized notebook with two pens for tasks and as a commonplace book. But honestly? I haven’t been using it. Meanwhile, I can’t seem to capture the constant stream of thoughts and ideas in my head, and life is demanding more of me than ever.  

This led me back to experimenting with task apps. I tried Habitica, but it didn’t click for me. Right now, I’m back to Todoist for managing tasks. My simple goal is this: **to get my life back on track.**  

I came across [*Rescuing Myself from Digital Hell*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qDnx-fcWqo) from EposVox, and it reflects something I’ve been chasing: simplicity in productivity.  

Where I feel lost is that I don’t know what I need to do. I don’t know what to plan. And honestly, I don’t know what my future holds at all.

## My Goals  

- **Return to my traveler’s notebook.** Use it for tasks and as a commonplace book. Be less delicate with it—let it actually hold my messy ideas, not just the “perfect” ones.  
- **Capture ideas freely.** Write down thoughts, even if they feel small or not worth it in the moment.  
- **Transfer important notes to digital.** Anything that matters should be moved into my note app so it can be searchable and accessible.  
- **Decommission the Ideals Journal.** Transition it fully to digital. It’s better to have it searchable than locked away in paper form.

This is where I am: standing between paper and digital, between old habits and new systems. But I’m ready to stop chasing the perfect productivity state and start using the tools I already have—both notebook and digital—to actually move forward.
