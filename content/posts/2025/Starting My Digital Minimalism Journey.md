I’m starting my Digital Minimalism journey because I’ve realized just how much of my life I’ve been spending online—mostly watching YouTube. I don’t take my laptop everywhere, but if I know I’m going somewhere I’ll be sitting for a while (like school), I bring it without thinking. I also made a post a while back about turning my phone into a PDA, and while that helped, it still wasn’t enough.

## What I’m Restricting Myself On

I’m restricting my access to **YouTube**, **Twitch**, and **Crunchyroll**. Twitch and Crunchyroll aren’t as big of a problem for me, but I’m blocking them anyway.

I’m using the Chrome extension **StayFocusd**, and I blocked all three sites with **zero time allowed**. I tested a version before where I blocked them until 6 PM, and that actually worked—except I cheated and disabled it. So this time, no loopholes.

## What I’m Replacing It With

Instead of wasting time on social media, I’m replacing it with:

- drawing  
- painting  
- blogging  
- making videos  
- building Gunpla  
- reading  
- studying  

I have a lot of projects that need real attention—some with aggressive deadlines and many steps involved. I can’t keep waiting until the last minute. I’ll share details on those projects when the time is right, but let’s just say I’ve got “five billion things” happening with no clear vision. This journey is meant to fix that.

## Why I’m Doing This

I started feeling like I wasn’t in control of my own destiny. My future felt unclear—like my ship was about to sink. On top of that, I felt like I lost my creative spark.

Coming up with ideas used to feel natural. I used to be the person who would think, *“What if I run Jellyfin on a Raspberry Pi 3+ with a CIFS/SMB network share to a 1TB USB HDD?”* That kind of random creativity used to flow constantly. That’s what I want back—along with my focus.

Digital minimalism feels like the path toward reclaiming that version of myself.
