## Summary
i have came to a epiphany that i have gotten bored of the music that i listen to. the genres that I would listen to. they lost the joy of listening to me. I don't know when it happen but it did. If anyone reads this you probably ran into the same thing that I just did i don't know of the fix.

## theory 1
I listen to a wholly different genre like classical music or country. That might work and find music that I would like there.

## theory 2
I stop listening to music for a month and see when I go back to it what would have changed since I am not listening to the same music over and over again.

## conclusion
The real answer is probably in between theory 1 and theory 2 where I stop listening to music to pass the time and when I do listen to music it is deliberate and with purpose to genres that I don't listen to normally.
