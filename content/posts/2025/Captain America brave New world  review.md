## Overview
*Captain America: Brave New World* was exactly what I expected from a Marvel movie. It wasn’t overly flashy, but it still managed to push the story forward — and that’s exactly what I was hoping for. I’m not an MCU fanboy, but I thought it was very good, and I’d recommend it to others.  

I wasn’t nitpicking the details of its quality. Instead, I just enjoyed it for what it was: a solid Marvel film that told its story well.

## Story and Characters
What I liked most was that the story focused primarily on **one main character** instead of splitting the spotlight across a team of two or three. Yes, there were other important characters, but the film didn’t feel like an ensemble piece. The focus stayed on Sam, and it made the story stronger.  

Story-wise, it didn’t disappoint. Sam was portrayed in a thoughtful, respectful way. It wasn’t just the usual formula of “bad guy shows up, big fight, we win.” There was more care and depth behind the storytelling.

## Visual Effects
The VFX were present, but not overwhelming. They supported the story instead of dominating it. Unlike *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania*—a film I skipped because the trailers made it look like it was drowning in effects—*Brave New World* kept things grounded.  

There were plenty of visual effects, but they blended naturally into the narrative rather than distracting from it.

## Final Verdict
Overall, *Captain America: Brave New World* delivered exactly what I wanted: a good story, strong character focus, and visuals that enhanced rather than overshadowed.  

**Final Rating: 8/10**  
**Recommended for:** Marvel fans who enjoy a grounded story with balanced action and character development.
