As someone who uses a 75% keyboard for ergonomic reasons, I’ve been searching for a compact, wireless number pad that could also double as a trackpad—something similar to Apple's Magic Trackpad but for Windows. When I came across the Sanpyl Numeric Keypad, it seemed like the perfect 2-in-1 solution.  

Unfortunately, it was a major disappointment.

## What I Wanted  
My goal was simple:  

- A number pad for occasional numeric input  
- A trackpad to swipe between virtual desktops (as I do on macOS)  
- Something compact to sit on the left side of my keyboard  

I originally had my eye on another product, but it was no longer being sold. So I settled on the Sanpyl. Here's how that turned out.

## What Went Wrong  

### 1. Tiny, Mushy Keys  
The keys are much too small and soft. Typing on them feels imprecise and sluggish—definitely not something you'd want to use regularly.  

### 2. Frustrating Trackpad Experience  
The trackpad is the biggest letdown:  

- It’s far too small, especially if you’re using a large display (mine is 42 inches).  
- It doesn’t support switching between desktops in Windows.  
- Gesture recognition is inconsistent—you can switch between applications, but it’s unreliable and uncomfortable due to the size.  
- Windows trackpad settings have no effect on its behavior.  
- It goes to sleep frequently, and waking it takes a few seconds of swiping and button pressing.  
- It often loses finger tracking mid-swipe, forcing you to lift your finger and start over.  

### 3. Build Quality Isn’t Enough  
Yes, it has an aluminum body and uses USB-C for charging. But what’s the point of good materials if the user experience is frustrating?

## Final Verdict  
At **$52.66**, the Sanpyl Numeric Keypad just isn’t worth the price. It’s slow, unresponsive, and clunky to use. I’ve ended up ignoring it completely—even though it sits right next to my keyboard.  

If all you need is a number pad, I strongly suggest picking up a dedicated one instead. And if you're looking for a trackpad, you're better off saving up for a high-quality standalone model. Don’t expect this 2-in-1 to do either job well.
