# the layout of it 
the controler layout is similer to the xbox controler with the trigers, thumsticks, and the abxy are in the same space. but the abxy is in the patern for nintindo so when it is conected to the pc the buttons use the xbox layout. there is a back paddles and a turbo button. and the face plate and tumn sticks are excangeable. i don't know about the battery life
