*Belle* is an anime film released in 2021. It feels like a modern Studio Ghibli-style movie, though it was directed by Mamoru Hosoda. The story blends classic fairy-tale themes with modern technology and virtual reality.

## Story Overview
The main character is **Sophie**. When she was young, her mother tragically died in a raging river while saving another girl. Although the girl was rescued, Sophie was left with the trauma of losing her mother. After the accident, she closed herself off from her family and lost the will to sing in front of people.  

Later, Sophie discovers a **VR world called “U.”** After creating her avatar, she joins the game, and one of the first things she does is sing. Her voice immediately captures attention, and she quickly rises to become one of the top idols within the virtual world.  

During one of her concerts, a **mysterious Beast** crashes the stage, pursued by players dressed like superheroes. He fights them off and flees. Curious about him, Sophie and her friends begin searching for the Beast’s true identity, hoping to uncover who he really is.

## My Opinion
To me, the story feels like a **modern retelling of *Beauty and the Beast***, but with a VR twist. This was my second time watching it, and it still holds up well.  

The world of *U* reminded me a lot of **VRChat**, with its mix of avatars, virtual performance, and community. The narrative is refreshing — it doesn’t wrap up like a typical Disney movie, and that makes it more memorable.  

The animation is beautiful, the music is powerful, and the emotional weight of Sophie’s journey gives the story depth.  

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

## Final Thoughts
