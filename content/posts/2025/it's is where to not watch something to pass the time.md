I started a personal challenge to stay off social media for 30 days.  
Today is **day 2**, and honestly? It feels weird not to constantly watch something just to pass the time.

This is the *withdrawal phase* that most people never push through. It usually takes about a week — sometimes longer — before the urge to fill every quiet moment with YouTube, Twitch, or other media finally fades.  

And right now, I’m definitely in that uncomfortable part of the process.

But I know this will get better. This part is supposed to feel hard.
