**Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf** was a huge refresher for me because it’s a simple story told extremely well. There are no explosions, no supernatural power-ups, and no flashy gimmicks—just grounded martial arts and human struggle.

The main character loses his parents at a young age and grows up training in martial arts. One night, an intruder breaks in and has already beaten his master’s daughter. While protecting her, the MC kills by throwing him head-first into a rock. That single moment forces him to go on the run and sets the entire story in motion.

This anime is a beat-’em-up, brawling anime that  in terms of pure martial arts and intense physicality, but without the unrealistic powers. It focuses on raw movement, discipline, and the struggle to keep martial arts traditions alive. The show hints at the MC having an “inner beast,” but it’s symbolic—representing his trauma, rage, and instinct—not a literal monster or supernatural force.

For me, **this is one of Netflix’s better martial arts anime**, and it’s only eight episodes long. The pacing is tight, the atmosphere stays grounded, and the visual style fits the tone perfectly.

**I give it a 9/10** for its storytelling, character focus, and artistic direction.
