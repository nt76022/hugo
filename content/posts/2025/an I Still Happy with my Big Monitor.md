sometime in the past year of two i have boaut a 42inch monitor and it’s is my primary display this is a chech up on if i reqreat my purchuse. youtube linkes will be down blow the blog.

Yes and no — I love the big monitor. I even took the smaller monitor off the side of my desk for it. But I don’t like it as much as I thought I would. It’s large, and while that’s great in some ways, many of its features would honestly work better if they were split into separate devices for a variety of reasons.

### KVM

To start with, the KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) switch setup is a bit of a hassle. It requires a USB and a display cable for each connected device, and there’s no easy way to manage those cables cleanly. Power is on one side of the monitor, while data and video inputs are on the other, making cable management awkward. Also, if one of your systems is powered off or sleeping, the USB ports on the monitor won’t stay active — so you can’t use them to wake the system up.

### PBP & PIP

I haven’t really used the PIP (Picture-in-Picture) or PBP (Picture-by-Picture) modes because they’re not very practical. The screen is too big to use PIP in any meaningful way — it just takes up valuable space from the main source underneath. As for PBP, it splits the screen in half, basically turning the display into two 24-inch monitors sitting side by side. That might sound good, but in portrait mode, it feels awkward and disjointed. Plus, the KVM gets disabled in PBP mode, so you can’t just switch inputs easily. In everyday use, portrait mode isn’t all that useful — it’s mostly good for reading text documents or writing.

### Final Thoughts

The monitor is great for editing videos, working with images, and multitasking — especially if you’re using a tiling window manager or similar setup. Honestly, though, two 24-inch monitors might be more practical for most people. That said, the large monitor _is_ excellent for gaming, video editing, and 3D work. I just don’t find it useful for _everything_, all the time. so i can’t recommend it if it is your primary display for everyday life but i can if it is for a pacific prepose.
