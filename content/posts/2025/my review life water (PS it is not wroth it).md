## Summary

I was at school recently and didn’t have any water with me. The school water tastes terrible, and I love trying fancy bottled water once in a while. So I bought a bottle of LIFEWTR from the vending machine.

## Review

This was my first time drinking LIFEWTR. Honestly… it’s just **okay**.  
Nothing special. Nothing fancy.

They advertise “perfect pH,” which basically just means the water is around a pH of 7 — neutral. The real issue is the taste. There *isn’t one.* Because they filter it so many times, the water has **no minerals** at all, which leaves it tasting extremely bland. No flavor, no character — just plain water but more expensive.

### Pros
- Fully recyclable bottle.  
That’s it.

### Cons
- Overpriced  
- No minerals  
- No flavor  
- No real benefits compared to regular filtered water  

### Conclusion
Don’t buy this water. It’s overpriced, has no taste, and doesn’t offer anything special. Just get a cheaper bottle or drink tap water with a filter.
