There are two main reasons I started blogging.

## 1. A Living Résumé and CV
Blogging gives me a way to showcase my personality, creativity, and technical skills in a format that’s always available. Instead of just handing someone a résumé, I can point them to my website where they see my projects, writing style, and interests. It’s proof of what I can do, not just a list of jobs.

## 2. Inspiration From Others
I was influenced by creators like [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUz3E9AW0w) and [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0), who both recommend starting a blog or personal website right now. Some of their videos that helped push me are:

- [You need a website RIGHT NOW!! (create a website for FREE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUz3E9AW0w)  
- [You STILL need a website RIGHT NOW!! (yes, even in 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0)  
- [I started a blog.....in 2024 (why you should too)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8)  
- [Why Everyone Needs a Personal Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWfIrmIgaCU)

On top of that, I stumbled across another blogger while searching for manga reviews that ChatGPT couldn’t help me find. His site, [Count Zero Or](https://countzeroor.com/), quickly became one of my favorites—I even added it to my RSS feed. He writes about movies, books, TV shows, manga, and anime, going into deeper dives than I usually do. He never really explained why he started his blog (at least that I’ve seen), but I respect his approach and recommend checking him out if you enjoy thoughtful reviews.
