Transistor is a game that came out on May 20, 2014. It is an RPG, sci-fi, action game that you can is a single-player game with Xbox controller support as well, I recommend that you play with the control for a better playing experience. The game was created by the people who created Bastion.

It takes you through a famous singer who lost her voice from the Evil group. The Eagle groups unleash monsters on the city and the only way is to use the sword the transistor. So you fight the monsters that took over the city and defeat them, finding out that there are clauses throwing terminals around the city.Â 

The game is dubbed with a voice that entranced you into the story with voice diaries and the sword has a will of its own. The game is sad with a sad ending that made me want to cry. All so the music is sad as well

The game is on the Epic Game Store, Steam, Nintendo Switch, and for PS4.
