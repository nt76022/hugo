# 🛠 Recent Favorites & Finds

Sometimes it’s the little things that make life easier. Here are a few small purchases I’ve made recently that have been surprisingly useful in my day-to-day.

## 🚗 ESR MagSafe Car Mount – $27

I’ve been looking for a simple, reliable way to keep my phone in place in my 2008 car, and this ESR MagSafe mount nails it. I’ve always loved the Apple MagSafe system—even though I use an Android phone with a MagSafe case. (No, it doesn’t mean I dislike Apple or the iPhone. I just stick with what I know.) The mount holds my phone securely and makes navigation so much more convenient.

## ⏱ Simple Cooking Timer – $14

This little timer has become a productivity tool for me, not just a kitchen gadget. It’s perfect for the Pomodoro technique—work for a set time, then take a break. I’ve been using it for 5-minute breaks after rearranging my study cards or tabs to help me remember key points before an exam. Sometimes analog tools are still the best.

## 🥤 Mini Blender Bottle – $14

I wanted something quick and easy for making protein shakes without dragging out my stick blender and a separate mixing cup. This small blender bottle does exactly that—shake, mix, and it’s ready. It’s a small upgrade, but it makes my daily routine smoother.

These are all inexpensive items, but each one has made a noticeable difference for me—whether it’s keeping my phone handy in the car, staying focused while studying, or making my shakes without the extra mess.
