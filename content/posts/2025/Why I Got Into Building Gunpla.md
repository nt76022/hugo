I got into building Gunpla after watching *Gundam* and following some Gunpla YouTubers. My favorite Gundam show is *Iron-Blooded Orphans* (IBO for short). I love it for the message it carries and the brutal honesty of its story. It’s a dark anime about child soldiers, and it really stuck with me.  

My very first kit was the **Barbatos Lupus Rex**, followed by the **Kimarus Vidar**. Since then, I’ve built over ten kits—and I even have a backlog (though nothing compared to my friend’s backlog of over 40 kits!). For me, Gunpla is a creative outlet. I build, paint, and even add LEDs whenever I can.

## My First Painted Kit
The first kit I painted was the **Landman Rodi**, which is basically the Rodi with an add-on kit to turn it into the Landman version. Before painting it, I spent a few days learning how to paint and practicing techniques to get a decent finish. I used a lot of scrap plastic spoons as practice pieces (and still do). That practice gave me confidence before painting my kit for real.

## Adding LEDs
Adding LEDs to my builds is a more recent hobby. I started with two SD kits, then moved on to a High Grade where I installed LEDs but haven’t fully wired them together yet. Instead of using batteries, I install **DC barrel jacks** so I can power the kits directly. This way, I don’t have to constantly change batteries, and I can turn the lights off when I go to bed.  

I tried wireless LEDs once, and while they work well for Master Grades, I prefer running small wired LEDs through my kits. It gives me more control and reliability.

## Other Builds
Not all of my builds are about LEDs or paint. For example, I once built a **bug-themed kit** without any LEDs or fancy paint. Even though it was simpler, it was still a fun project. Parts have started falling off over time, so I’d like to rebuild it one day. At the end of the day, I’m a Gunpla builder first—not a car modeler or anything else. Gunpla gives me both the challenge and the creativity I enjoy.
