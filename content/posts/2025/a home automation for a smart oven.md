I came up with a very useful idea for home automation. It’s based on having a database of recipes with their required temperatures.

This idea came to me when my mom started the oven for some Walmart pizza, and the temperature stayed the same as before. So, what if you could simply ask your smart speaker to not only turn on the oven but also set it to the correct temperature for a specific recipe?

For example, you could say:

> “Hey Alexa, turn the oven on for some Walmart pizza.”

The system would then check the recipe database, find the right temperature and time, and automatically set the oven for you.
