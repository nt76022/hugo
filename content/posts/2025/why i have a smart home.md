# Why I Have a Smart Home in 2025

I have a smart home for a few reasons, but they mainly come down to **creativity** and **being hands-off**.

To be honest, I don’t see someone owning an Alexa or another smart speaker as truly having a smart home—that’s just a fancy light switch. And apps aren’t the full answer either.

## Being Creative
- I enjoy building **cool automation**, like having my lights change to random colors or using a web-hook from my notes app to start my kettle.
- It’s fun for me as a consumer to buy interesting gadgets that give me new possibilities for automation.

---

## Being Hands-Off
- **Improving efficiency** so the human element doesn’t forget: for example, my AC automatically switches from 64°F at night to 72°F when I open the door in the morning.
- Eliminating unnecessary **context switching**—I don’t have to stop what I’m doing to handle small tasks.
- **Improving family living** by having lights turn on automatically so people can see where they’re going and avoid touching light switches, which also reduces germ spread.

## Conclusion
Do I *need* a smart home? No—plenty of people live without one.  
But as a nerd who values productivity and the ease of walking into a room without doing anything, I’m a power user. I self-host my own system with **Home Assistant**, which makes my setup both hands-off in daily use and hands-on when it comes to building and maintaining it.
