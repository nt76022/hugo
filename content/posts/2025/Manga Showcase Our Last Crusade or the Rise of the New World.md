## Manga Showcase Our Last Crusade or the Rise of the New World
The manga was released from May 11, 2018, to March 12, 2021. It consists of seven books. This showcase focuses on the manga, not the light novels or anime. I have wanted to read it ever since I watched the first season. The anime doesn’t differ much from the manga, if at all.

This manga takes place in a fantasy, sci-fi world where magic exists. The protagonist, Iska, is a soldier from the Empire, which has been at war with the Sovereignty, a nation ruled by mages, for over a century. Iska dreams of a future where humans and mages can coexist in peace instead of being enemies.

### Plot Summary
Iska is imprisoned after freeing a mage (who later returns in the story). Upon his release, he is given a new mission: defeat the Ice Calamity Witch, a powerful mage from the opposing side. Along the way, he reunites with his old squad and faces numerous challenges.

During his journey, Iska falls in love with Aliceliese, the Ice Calamity Witch. Their battles always end in a draw, yet they continue to encounter each other by chance. Over time, they realize they share an appreciation for art and food and, more importantly, the same dream of peace between humans and mages.

Later in the story, it is revealed that the mage Iska saved was Sisbell, the third princess of the Sovereignty. Due to her astral power, which allows her to see into the past, members of her own homeland want her dead. Iska and his team meet her in a neutral city, where she asks him to become her knight, as she no longer trusts the mages in the palace.

As events unfold, Iska's commander turns into a mage, forcing the squad to find bandages that suppress magic energy. Eventually, Iska meets Elletear, the eldest princess, who enjoys playing mind games with him and his team. She invites them to the summer palace, where instead of battles, awkward romantic moments unfold.

At one point, Aliceliese walks in on Iska holding her underwear, as Sisbell was teasing him. In his defense, he was simply holding a pile of clothes, trying to return them. Later, Elletear invites him to her room, seeking his attention just like her sisters. Somehow, Iska ends up sharing a bed with the princesses.

### Final Thoughts
This is just an overview of the story. If you want to experience more, you can watch the anime, although it doesn’t cover the last two volumes. You can also read the manga for the full story. Speaking of the anime, it remains incomplete, and I hope they continue it in the future.
