## Why
To remove friction from my daily workflow, to never waste time searching, and to have my environment anticipate my needs.  
My desktop is not a playground of floating windows or clutter like Microsoft Windows — it is a streamlined system that has grown over years of refining, testing, and learning from others.

## Core Principles
### 1. Never Search For Anything
- Every app has a home.  
- I keep at least three essentials open at all times:  
  1. **Terminal** → to destroy and rebuild my system as needed.  
  2. **Web Browser** → to consume, test, and overload my memory.  
  3. **Notes App** → to capture thoughts, configs, and system insights.  
- These live in **workspaces 1–3** in Hyprland. No digging. No hunting. Always there.  

**Philosophy:** If it’s important, it already has a place. I’m not “finding” — I’m *jumping*.

### 2. Ease of Flow
I design layers of access that remove thought from the process:  
- **Level 1 (Instant)** → Hotkeys bound to my most used apps:  
  - Web Browser, File Explorer, Terminal, Notes.  
  - No wasted hand movement. No menus.  
- **Level 2 (Quick Access)** → Macropad for weekly-use tools:  
  - OBS for recording.  
  - Other utilities I don’t need daily but don’t want to search for.  
- **Level 3 (Rare)** → Search only when needed:  
  - Wallpaper setter, edge-case apps.  
  - One quick `rofi/wofi` or finder query, then done.  

**Philosophy:** Flow is sacred. If I can cut steps, I cut them. If I can bind it, I bind it.

## Telos Statement
My desktop is my environment of **control, flow, and confidence**.  
Every app, keybind, and workspace serves the singular purpose: to never waste time searching, never waste energy on the PC — but to be creative and effective in my work.
