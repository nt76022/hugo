## What am I saying?

Mental fatigue is your mind’s ability to self-regulate breaking down over time.

When mental fatigue gets high, you don’t want to do anything responsible. You feel lazy, unmotivated, and avoid effort. For example, after a long day of work, you know you *should* eat healthy, but you don’t want to deal with it.

From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed, mental fatigue slowly increases.

## Fatigue

This is all speculation on my part, based on my own thoughts and experiences.

Imagine that as you go through the day, you gain about **1% of fatigue every X minutes**. Certain activities spike it much faster. For example, every meeting might add **around 5%** or more.

Everyone is different. Fatigue builds differently depending on the person, their job, their stress level, and their environment.

The goal is not to ever reach **100% fatigue**. Once you’re there, you’re basically just doing whatever makes you feel good in that moment, even if it’s not good for you long-term.

## Information overload

This also applies to information gathering.

Every video, article, livestream, or notification adds a little bit of fatigue. According to an article from [Minecheck](https://www.minecheck.com/posts/your-brain-is-processing-more-data-than-you-would-ever-imagine/#:~:text=Information%20scientists%20have%20found%20that,the%20equivalent%20of%20174%20newspapers.), humans observe the equivalent of **around 74GB of information per day**.

Even if we aren’t consciously paying attention, our brains are still processing it. Each piece of information adds **X%** to mental fatigue.

Over time, this constant input makes it harder to focus, make good decisions, or stay motivated.

### What makes you get fatigued faster?

### How to reduce mental fatigue

- Listening to music  
- Going to the gym  
- Taking a nap  
- Meditating  
- Journaling  

These don’t remove fatigue completely, but they help slow it down or reset it enough to function again.
