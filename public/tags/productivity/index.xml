&lt;p>I have a smart home for a few reasons, but they mainly come down to &lt;strong>creativity&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>being hands-off&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, I don’t see someone owning an Alexa or another smart speaker as truly having a smart home—that’s just a fancy light switch. And apps aren’t the full answer either.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="being-creative">Being Creative&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I enjoy building &lt;strong>cool automation&lt;/strong>, like having my lights change to random colors or using a web-hook from my notes app to start my kettle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s fun for me as a consumer to buy interesting gadgets that give me new possibilities for automation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="being-hands-off">Being Hands-Off&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving efficiency&lt;/strong> so the human element doesn’t forget: for example, my AC automatically switches from 64°F at night to 72°F when I open the door in the morning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eliminating unnecessary &lt;strong>context switching&lt;/strong>—I don’t have to stop what I’m doing to handle small tasks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving family living&lt;/strong> by having lights turn on automatically so people can see where they’re going and avoid touching light switches, which also reduces germ spread.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Do I &lt;em>need&lt;/em> a smart home? No—plenty of people live without one.&lt;br>
But as a nerd who values productivity and the ease of walking into a room without doing anything, I’m a power user. I self-host my own system with &lt;strong>Home Assistant&lt;/strong>, which makes my setup both hands-off in daily use and hands-on when it comes to building and maintaining it.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
