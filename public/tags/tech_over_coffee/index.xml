<p>I have a smart home for a few reasons, but they mainly come down to <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>being hands-off</strong>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t see someone owning an Alexa or another smart speaker as truly having a smart home—that’s just a fancy light switch. And apps aren’t the full answer either.</p>

<h2 id="being-creative">Being Creative</h2>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy building <strong>cool automation</strong>, like having my lights change to random colors or using a web-hook from my notes app to start my kettle.</li>
<li>It’s fun for me as a consumer to buy interesting gadgets that give me new possibilities for automation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="being-hands-off">Being Hands-Off</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improving efficiency</strong> so the human element doesn’t forget: for example, my AC automatically switches from 64°F at night to 72°F when I open the door in the morning.</li>
<li>Eliminating unnecessary <strong>context switching</strong>—I don’t have to stop what I’m doing to handle small tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Improving family living</strong> by having lights turn on automatically so people can see where they’re going and avoid touching light switches, which also reduces germ spread.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do I <em>need</em> a smart home? No—plenty of people live without one.<br>
But as a nerd who values productivity and the ease of walking into a room without doing anything, I’m a power user. I self-host my own system with <strong>Home Assistant</strong>, which makes my setup both hands-off in daily use and hands-on when it comes to building and maintaining it.</p>
