<p>Sometimes itâ€™s the little things that make life easier. Here are a few small purchases Iâ€™ve made recently that have been surprisingly useful in my day-to-day.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-esr-magsafe-car-mount--27">ðŸš— ESR MagSafe Car Mount â€“ $27</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve been looking for a simple, reliable way to keep my phone in place in my 2008 car, and this ESR MagSafe mount nails it. Iâ€™ve always loved the Apple MagSafe systemâ€”even though I use an Android phone with a MagSafe case. (No, it doesnâ€™t mean I dislike Apple or the iPhone. I just stick with what I know.) The mount holds my phone securely and makes navigation so much more convenient.

<p>This is a fun alternate take on the <em>86</em> characters, placing them in a typical Japanese high school setting. It doesnâ€™t connect to the main series canon, but all the character quirks and charm are still present. It&rsquo;s a standalone volume, self-contained with 16 chapters and a character list at the end. The pace is light and easy, with a comfortable slice-of-life flow.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>people are making there smart home wrong because we gave them the wrong ideas. why i say that it is because we have marked it as a smart speaker that dose it all. that we will have a JARVIS that will make it all work like what we see in iron man. that idea is not bad but we are doing something that is not going to work for the long jevery but fast and not a hastel. but i shoud be clear that i am not a expert in a smart home but i do know that we see it as wee speak to a google home or a Alexa. with that is not the ancer becasuse of 2 reations.</p>

<p>I have a smart home for a few reasons, but they mainly come down to <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>being hands-off</strong>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I donâ€™t see someone owning an Alexa or another smart speaker as truly having a smart homeâ€”thatâ€™s just a fancy light switch. And apps arenâ€™t the full answer either.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="being-creative">Being Creative</h2>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy building <strong>cool automation</strong>, like having my lights change to random colors or using a web-hook from my notes app to start my kettle.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s fun for me as a consumer to buy interesting gadgets that give me new possibilities for automation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="being-hands-off">Being Hands-Off</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improving efficiency</strong> so the human element doesnâ€™t forget: for example, my AC automatically switches from 64Â°F at night to 72Â°F when I open the door in the morning.</li>
<li>Eliminating unnecessary <strong>context switching</strong>â€”I donâ€™t have to stop what Iâ€™m doing to handle small tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Improving family living</strong> by having lights turn on automatically so people can see where theyâ€™re going and avoid touching light switches, which also reduces germ spread.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do I <em>need</em> a smart home? Noâ€”plenty of people live without one.<br>
But as a nerd who values productivity and the ease of walking into a room without doing anything, Iâ€™m a power user. I self-host my own system with <strong>Home Assistant</strong>, which makes my setup both hands-off in daily use and hands-on when it comes to building and maintaining it.</p>

            <p>The definition of productivity (such as time, labor, or materials) is to produce a desired outcome, output, or result. But why do I say it&rsquo;s snake oil?</p>
<p>Itâ€™s unmeasured and undefined. What most people call productivity is really just busywork. We measure it in quantity before qualityâ€”and thereâ€™s a big difference.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a quote: <strong>&ldquo;Bite off more than you can chew.&rdquo;</strong> Thatâ€™s what people are doing in the pursuit of productivity. So we end up turning in half-hearted work, which we sometimes have to redo, just to say we got more done. It&rsquo;s not attainableâ€”there&rsquo;s always more to do. So we rush, repeat, and burn out.</p>
