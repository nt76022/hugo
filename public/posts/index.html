But I don’t like it as much as I thought I would. It’s large, and while that’s great in some ways, many of its features would honestly work better if they were split into separate devices for a variety of reasons.</p><hr><h3 id=kvm>KVM</h3><p>To start with, the KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) switch setup is a bit of a hassle. It requires a USB and a display cable for each connected device, and there’s no easy way to manage those cables cleanly. Power is on one side of the monitor, while data and video inputs are on the other, making cable management awkward. Also, if one of your systems is powered off or sleeping, the USB ports on the monitor won’t stay active — so you can’t use them to wake the system up.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2025/an-i-still-happy-with-my-big-monitor/>→</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://caseyjrobinson.com/posts/2025/building-an-overkill-home-nas-san/>Building an Overkill Home NAS SAN</a></h1><div class=post-meta></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=https://caseyjrobinson.com/tags/tag1/>tag1</a>&nbsp;

The mount holds my phone securely and makes navigation so much more convenient.
