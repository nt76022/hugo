<meta charset=utf-8><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><meta name=description content=" I have a smart home for a few reasons, but they mainly come down to creativity and being hands-off.
To be honest, I don’t see someone owning an Alexa or another smart speaker as truly having a smart home—that’s just a fancy light switch. And apps aren’t the full answer either.
Being Creative I enjoy building cool automation, like having my lights change to random colors or using a web-hook from my notes app to start my kettle. It’s fun for me as a consumer to buy interesting gadgets that give me new possibilities for automation. Being Hands-Off Improving efficiency so the human element doesn’t forget: for example, my AC automatically switches from 64°F at night to 72°F when I open the door in the morning. Eliminating unnecessary context switching—I don’t have to stop what I’m doing to handle small tasks. Improving family living by having lights turn on automatically so people can see where they’re going and avoid touching light switches, which also reduces germ spread. Conclusion Do I need a smart home? No—plenty of people live without one.
But as a nerd who values productivity and the ease of walking into a room without doing anything, I’m a power user. I self-host my own system with Home Assistant, which makes my setup both hands-off in daily use and hands-on when it comes to building and maintaining it.
