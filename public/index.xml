&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s the little things that make life easier. Here are a few small purchases I’ve made recently that have been surprisingly useful in my day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-esr-magsafe-car-mount--27&#34;&gt;🚗 ESR MagSafe Car Mount – $27&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking for a simple, reliable way to keep my phone in place in my 2008 car, and this ESR MagSafe mount nails it. I’ve always loved the Apple MagSafe system—even though I use an Android phone with a MagSafe case. (No, it doesn’t mean I dislike Apple or the iPhone. I just stick with what I know.) The mount holds my phone securely and makes navigation so much more convenient.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-simple-cooking-timer--14&#34;&gt;⏱ Simple Cooking Timer – $14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little timer has become a productivity tool for me, not just a kitchen gadget. It’s perfect for the Pomodoro technique—work for a set time, then take a break. I’ve been using it for 5-minute breaks after rearranging my study cards or tabs to help me remember key points before an exam. Sometimes analog tools are still the best.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ovBdqiPEL._AC_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-mini-blender-bottle--14&#34;&gt;🥤 Mini Blender Bottle – $14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted something quick and easy for making protein shakes without dragging out my stick blender and a separate mixing cup. This small blender bottle does exactly that—shake, mix, and it’s ready. It’s a small upgrade, but it makes my daily routine smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all inexpensive items, but each one has made a noticeable difference for me—whether it’s keeping my phone handy in the car, staying focused while studying, or making my shakes without the extra mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; Asato Asato&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Artist:&lt;/strong&gt; Suzume Somemiya&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Genres:&lt;/strong&gt; Romance, Slice of Life&lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-story--pacing&#34;&gt;🧭 Story &amp;amp; Pacing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fun alternate take on the &lt;em&gt;86&lt;/em&gt; characters, placing them in a typical Japanese high school setting. It doesn’t connect to the main series canon, but all the character quirks and charm are still present. It&amp;rsquo;s a standalone volume, self-contained with 16 chapters and a character list at the end. The pace is light and easy, with a comfortable slice-of-life flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-characters&#34;&gt;👥 Characters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus is on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lena&lt;/strong&gt; – Student Council President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shin&lt;/strong&gt; – Quiet but reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story builds on the developing bond between Lena and Shin, leaning into sweet and subtle romantic moments. Other familiar characters make appearances too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-art--paneling&#34;&gt;🎨 Art &amp;amp; Paneling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art follows a clean, standard manga style. It’s easy to follow with good panel flow and expressive characters, sticking to classic shoujo/slice-of-life visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-themes--tone&#34;&gt;🎭 Themes &amp;amp; Tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manga reimagines the core &lt;em&gt;86&lt;/em&gt; cast in a lighthearted school setting. The tone is playful and romantic, with no war or politics—just uniforms, student council meetings, and teenage awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-personal-thoughts&#34;&gt;💭 Personal Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an easy, enjoyable read with no complex plotlines. I’d love to see more volumes like this in the future—it’s a great &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; side story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-final-rating&#34;&gt;⭐️ Final Rating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating:&lt;/strong&gt; ★★★★☆ (7/10)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Recommended for:&lt;/strong&gt; ★★★★★★★★☆☆ (8/10)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Similar To:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I Had That Same Dream Again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;reson-one-we-are-to-lazy-and-or-cant-talk&#34;&gt;reson one we are to lazy and/ or can&amp;rsquo;t talk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the reson is that we don&amp;rsquo;t like saying &amp;ldquo;hay voice thing trun on lights &amp;quot; all the time like trying to say something to a baby that will anoy it. it is a repetdevme take that will get turing to do every single time you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ather reason is that there is a time and place to use your voice and when it is at the meddle of the knight with your partner right beside you is proble not one of them.  to you want it to be able to do athing with your voice it should for one off idem that will be hard to asing a button or some ather sencer to it but it is not worth trying to figer it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-secont-reason-is-that-it-is-akword&#34;&gt;the secont reason is that it is akword&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to speak out loud is akword to people then to add it to a voice assistant that people are going to look at you weard for. yes i do see what i can do with my voice assistant but it still make it weard where a peoson is looking at you case you wanted to change the lights in your houce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-get-me-started-on-the-apps-that-you-need-to-use&#34;&gt;dont get me started on the apps that you need to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the apps that you need to install a light bulb or a another device is ovsern so and thet there is no sorce of turth to the. so where are the automations going to be. non of them talk to each athure and mater is a joke it is not yet a voible product that a device that talks to the network and set up a ;ocal conmication. it is a fance local api that we had in some smart home produts like the shellys. yes it is sopoce to use the same comands but they don&amp;rsquo;t haft to. or beable to usdthem aquase plat form to begen with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that is why we dare building are smart homes wrong and i am not the all seeing peorson. so i cant give the ancer to it but this is my insted from my experance of buildimy my smart home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why i have a smart home</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/why-i-have-a-smart-home/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a smart home for a few reasons, but they mainly come down to &lt;strong&gt;creativity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;being hands-off&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t see someone owning an Alexa or another smart speaker as truly having a smart home—that’s just a fancy light switch. And apps aren’t the full answer either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-creative&#34;&gt;Being Creative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoy building &lt;strong&gt;cool automation&lt;/strong&gt;, like having my lights change to random colors or using a web-hook from my notes app to start my kettle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s fun for me as a consumer to buy interesting gadgets that give me new possibilities for automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-hands-off&#34;&gt;Being Hands-Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; so the human element doesn’t forget: for example, my AC automatically switches from 64°F at night to 72°F when I open the door in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminating unnecessary &lt;strong&gt;context switching&lt;/strong&gt;—I don’t have to stop what I’m doing to handle small tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving family living&lt;/strong&gt; by having lights turn on automatically so people can see where they’re going and avoid touching light switches, which also reduces germ spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a smart home? No—plenty of people live without one.&lt;br&gt;
But as a nerd who values productivity and the ease of walking into a room without doing anything, I’m a power user. I self-host my own system with &lt;strong&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes my setup both hands-off in daily use and hands-on when it comes to building and maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Productivity Is Snake Oil</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/why-productivity-is-snake-oil/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/why-productivity-is-snake-oil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The definition of productivity (such as time, labor, or materials) is to produce a desired outcome, output, or result. But why do I say it&amp;rsquo;s snake oil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unmeasured and undefined. What most people call productivity is really just busywork. We measure it in quantity before quality—and there’s a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quote: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bite off more than you can chew.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; That’s what people are doing in the pursuit of productivity. So we end up turning in half-hearted work, which we sometimes have to redo, just to say we got more done. It&amp;rsquo;s not attainable—there&amp;rsquo;s always more to do. So we rush, repeat, and burn out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So we rush, repeat, and burn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not your fault. It’s the system you were pushed into. And that same system burns out people in similar professions—like software engineers—over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-ai&#34;&gt;Let’s Talk About AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re in the age of AI, and yeah, maybe I’m being a little dramatic, but it’s true: AI is going to change the way we work. It might not take your job outright, but it will make you feel more detached from your work—and maybe even from your passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t grow as a society if we let AI do everything for us. If you use AI just to get more work done faster, you’ll be expected to do even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;, and then burnout will hit even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-not-against-self-help-or-tools&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Not Against Self-Help or Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I like reading self-help books. I’m currently reading &lt;em&gt;How to Build a Second Brain&lt;/em&gt; by Tiago Forte. The intention behind it is to get better at my craft—to capture and reference things like my coffee setup, water temp, grind size, and not forget them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m not against productivity tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m also not for being so obsessed with work that I lose all passion for it.&lt;/p&gt;
